	"text_faq_content_1": "Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses encryption technology to conduct secure transactions, control the generation of new units, and verify the transfer of assets. It is usually supported by a distributed network rather than controlled by a central bank or government agency. Cryptocurrency has many advantages, including decentralization, not controlled by a central agency, reducing dependence on a single entity; using cryptography technology to ensure transaction security and user privacy; transaction records are open and transparent, enhancing system trust and reliability; can be used globally, cross-border transfers are fast and inexpensive; once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be revoked or tampered with, reducing the risk of fraud; and limited supply, preventing inflation and keeping the value of the currency stable. Cryptocurrency has a wide range of applications in financial technology, investment, payment, and crowdfunding, and is gradually changing the traditional financial system.",
